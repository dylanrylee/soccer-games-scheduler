# Soccer Match Schedule Optimizer

**AI-Driven Scheduler for Soccer Matches**  
Built using Python and an And-Tree-based constraint satisfaction model, this project generates optimized soccer game schedules under real-world constraints such as team availability, field times, and referee assignments.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a term assignment (Sep–Dec 2024) by a 5→3 member team. The goal was to implement an AI-based scheduler capable of solving complex constraint-based problems using algorithmic techniques.

**Features:**

- Constraint-based scheduling using a custom AI model
- And-Tree search logic for efficient backtracking and pruning
- Formal mathematical model to define problem state and transitions
- Tested on 10+ real-world scenarios with varied constraints

## Technical Highlights

- **Algorithm Design**: Developed a custom And-Tree-based search algorithm to represent the state space and recursively enforce hard constraints.
- **Constraint Modeling**: Included team match limits, venue availability, non-overlapping times, and referee assignments.
- **State Transitions**: Modeled actions (e.g., assigning a team or field) as state transitions validated by constraint functions.
- **Test Suite**: Evaluated on multiple test cases to measure solution validity and efficiency.
